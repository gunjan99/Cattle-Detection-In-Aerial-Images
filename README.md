# Cattle-Detection-In-Aerial-Images
This was my CSIR-CEERI project for the period of 2 months from May 20, 2019 to July 13, 2019. for this project I created dataset of my own using the videos obtained online(around 1500 images were obtained and trained upon). Since not much data was available so testing was done using random images picked from google images.For this project I used fizyr's implementation of retinanet. In this implementation I made two changes: 1) Added a new anchor size of 32 as aerial images are smaller in size 2) skip_mismatch parameter was set to true
